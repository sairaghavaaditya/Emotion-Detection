Face Emotion Recognition
Description
This project utilizes deep learning techniques to recognize emotions from facial expressions. It involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify emotions from images and using this trained model for real-time emotion detection via webcam.

Installation
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install jupyter
pip install notebook
pip install tqdm
pip install opencv-contrib-python
pip install scikit-learn
or
(Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt))


USAGE
 Model Training
 1.Ensure your training and testing images are organized in the following directory structure:
     images/
├── train/
│   ├── angry/
│   ├── disgust/
│   ├── fear/
│   ├── happy/
│   ├── neutral/
│   ├── sad/
│   └── surprise/
└── test/
    ├── angry/
    ├── disgust/
    ├── fear/
    ├── happy/
    ├── neutral/
    ├── sad/
    └── surprise/

 2.Run the Jupyter Notebook trainmodel.ipynb to train the model:
           jupyter notebook trainmodel.ipynb
     
 3.After training, the model architecture will be saved as facialemotionmodel.json and the model weights as facialemotionmodel.h5.

Real-Time Detection
 1.Ensure your webcam is connected and functional.
 2.Run the real-time detection script:
   bash
   python realtimedetection.py



REAL-TIME-DETECTION
 1.Ensure your webcam is connected and functional.
 2.Run the real-time detection script:
  python realtimedetection.py
 3.The webcam feed will open, and detected faces along with their predicted emotions will be  displayed in real-time.



ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Importance of This Project
1.Enhancing Human-Computer Interaction
Face emotion recognition technology significantly enhances human-computer interaction (HCI). By enabling systems to understand and respond to human emotions, it creates more intuitive and user-friendly interfaces, improving user experience and satisfaction.

2.Applications in Mental Health
This technology can be instrumental in mental health care. It can help therapists and caregivers monitor patients' emotional states over time, providing valuable insights into their mental health and facilitating early intervention when necessary.

3.Personalized User Experiences
By understanding and responding to the user's emotional state, various applications can provide highly personalized experiences. Whether it's adjusting the tone of virtual assistants or curating content that matches the user's mood, emotion recognition can make digital interactions more human-like.
